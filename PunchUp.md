# What is the work you’re taking on?
My punch up proposal will be a visitor wall. It will be in its own tab. 
Visitors will first see a wall of sticky notes, and have the option to leave their own. 

# How do you think this is going to enhance your body of work? Will it be a new entry, or an interesting interaction?
It demonstrates how I think about designing for participation.
Having an easy social interactions creates warmth/community within an otherwise static portfolio space.
It also shows how small, thoughtful interactions can add personality and memorability to a digital experience.

# Lo-fi mock-ups of the concept.
Please find it in public/punchUp.jpg

# Examples to help explain your concept.
  - [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/)  
    Real time sticky notes
  - [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/)
    Reddit thread where users, each having only 1px of space, get together and create images
    
# Any resources you plan on using.
  - React useState for creating the sticky notes
  - Supabase for storing data and keeping them on the wall

# Any fears, uncertainties, doubts about the implementation.
  - Moderating it, what if someone puts something inappropriate?
  - Is it getting the notes to persist going to be hard? I’ve never used Supabase before
  - How would it look on mobile?
  - Would load times be slower if there's too many? (assuming it gets to that point)
